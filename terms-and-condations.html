            <p class="mt-3">Effective as of November 30th 2020</p>
        </div>
        <div class="privacy-body">
            <p>These terms of service (“Terms”) are a legally binding contract between you and Clasiq, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Clasiq,” “we,” “us,” or “our”), that you are agreeing to by registering for a Clasiq account or by accessing or using our website and/or our online and/or mobile services (including any email, messaging, materials, software, or other functionality of any kind) or any part of it (the “Services”). You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Clasiq and only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules, and regulations. If you do not agree with these Terms, do not register or use any of the Services.</p>
            <p>If you are using the Services on behalf of an organization (for example, you are an account administrator), you are agreeing to these Terms for that organization and are representing and warranting to us that you have the authority to bind that organization to these Terms (in which event, “you” and “your” will refer to that organization).</p>
            <p>ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION/JURY TRIAL WAIVER PROVISION THAT REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES, RATHER THAN JURY TRIALS OR CLASS ACTIONS.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Registration and Accounts</h3>
            <p>If your use of the Services requires registration, you must complete the registration process by providing complete and accurate information. You must also provide and maintain one dedicated email address for communications with Clasiq. You must be at least 18 years old to register for an account. Any use or access to any of the Services by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of these Terms.</p>
            <p>The Services have different features and may have different levels of access for various users or depending on how you use the Services or which Services you use. We may change user roles and/or functionality at any time, and these Terms apply to all users regardless of whether they are buyers, sellers, visitors, users, or others who register for or otherwise access the Services for any reason. Certain Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions specified by us from time to time, and your use of such Services is subject to those additional terms and conditions, which are hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference. For the avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties acknowledge and agree that these Terms are solely a contract between you and Clasiq and expressly do not govern any sale, transaction, or other relationship between you and any other user, including without limitation with respect to any buyer or seller or any vehicle sale contract in connection with an auction hosted on the Services or with respect to any Third-Party Content or Third-Party Integration (defined below). Clasiq shall have no liability for your interactions with other users or for any user’s action or inaction.</p>
            <p>The Services comprise a vehicle listing, information service, and auction platform delivered via a website, mobile site, app, email, messaging, call center, and other means, from time to time, to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. THE SERVICES AND CLASIQ ARE NOT AN AUTOMOBILE BROKER OR DEALER AND DO NOT SELL, EXCHANGE, BUY, OFFER FOR SALE, NEGOTIATE, OR ATTEMPT TO NEGOTIATE A SALE OR EXCHANGE OF AN INTEREST IN ANY VEHICLE LISTED FOR SALE ON THE SERVICES. CLASIQ DOES NOT HOLD OR POSSESS TITLE FOR ANY VEHICLE LISTED FOR SALE ON THE SERVICE. While Clasiq and the Services may contain links, integrations, or other information regarding Third-Party Content and Third-Party Integrations, neither Clasiq nor the Services themselves offer or provide any ancillary products and services, such as vehicle financing, service contracts, mechanical breakdown insurance, vehicle registration/titling, vehicle inspections, appraisals, and vehicle transfer escrow or wallet services. All ancillary products and services are provided by and subject to the terms of the applicable third parties (see Section 12 below for more details on Third-Party Content and Third-Party Integrations).</p>
            <p>If you are an account administrator, “your users” includes any employee, contractor, agent, or representative visiting the site or using the Services on your behalf. You are solely responsible for all usage of, or activities on, the Services by you and by those you authorize or allow to use, or provide access to, the Services.</p>
            <p>You are solely responsible for all files and information that you or your users upload to or share through Clasiq and will ensure that your users comply with your obligations under these Terms. We may impose reasonable limits on uses of the Services to prevent degradation of the performance of the Services for you or other users.</p>
            <p>Only you may use your account and are responsible for your account. If you become aware of any unauthorized use of the Services or your account, please contact us immediately at info@clasiq.com. In addition, you are solely responsible to ensure that your hardware, network, Internet connection, and other equipment meet the requirements to use the Services.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will post the most current version of these Terms on our website. Any revisions to these Terms will be effective immediately upon posting by us. For any material changes to these Terms, we will take reasonable steps to notify you of such changes, via a banner on the website, email notification, another method, or combination of methods. In all cases, your continued use of the Services after publication of such changes, with or without notification, constitutes binding acceptance of the revised Terms.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Changes to the Services</h3>
            <p>We are constantly changing and improving the Services. We may deploy changes, updates, or enhancements to the Services at any time. We may also add or remove functionalities or features, or we may suspend or stop the Services altogether. Accordingly, either you or Clasiq may terminate your use of any Service for any reason at any time.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Suspension or Termination of Your Account</h3>
            <p>We may suspend or terminate your account for any violation of these Terms, for any activities prohibited by these Terms, for circumstances beyond our control, or if required by law. If we do so, then your access to and use of the Services will be suspended or terminated immediately..</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3 text-theme">Auction Listings and Bidding</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Sellers</h3>
            <p>In connection with the Services, auction sellers agree to list the applicable vehicle exclusively on the Services for the duration of the auction and to provide Clasiq a reserve amount indicating the minimum price at which the seller will make a sale of the listed vehicle (the “Reserve”) prior to the listing being made available on the Services. While Seller may reduce the Reserve during the auction, Seller shall not be permitted to increase the Reserve unless approved in advance in writing by Clasiq.</p>
            <p>EACH SELLER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT FOLLOWING THE VEHICLE LISTING BEING MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES AND FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD THAT SUCH LISTING IS MADE AVAILABLE ON THE SERVICES, SUCH SELLER (OR ANYONE ACTING ON SELLER’S BEHALF) MAY NOT LIST, POST, OR OTHERWISE MAKE AVAILABLE THE VEHICLE SUBJECT TO SUCH LISTING ON ANY OTHER AUCTION, DEALERSHIP, OR LISTING SERVICE. FURTHERMORE, EACH SELLER HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY LISTING MAY BE REMOVED FOR ANY REASON AT CLASIQ’S SOLE DISCRETION WITHOUT NOTICE AND WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY THEREFOR.</p>
            <p>In Clasiq’s sole and absolute discretion, following the close of an auction, if no bid has met the Reserve, Clasiq may offer to pay Seller an amount equal to the difference between the Reserve and the highest bid; provided that such amount shall only be owed by Clasiq if and when such Seller’s vehicle is actually sold to such highest bidder, and Seller shall provide Clasiq with all documentation relating to such sale within thirty (30) days of closing such sale. SELLER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT THE OFFERING OR PROVISION OF SUCH AMOUNT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PARAGRAPH IS AN INDEPENDENT TRANSACTION AND DOES NOT IN ANY WAY MAKE CLASIQ A PARTY TO ANY SALE OF THE SELLER’S APPLICABLE VEHICLE OR OTHER TRANSACTION BETWEEN SELLER AND BUYER.</p>
            <p>If you list a vehicle for auction through the Services, you represent and warrant to Clasiq that: (a) your title to the vehicle is marketable, insurable, and free of any and all liens and encumbrances; (b) you have full power, right, and authority to convey title to the vehicle to an auction buyer, if any, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances; (c) there are no defects in title or other outstanding contracts or agreements of any kind for the sale of the vehicle except as expressly disclosed to potential buyers through the Services; (d) if the vehicle (or any part thereof) has any material defect, you will communicate same to any potential buyer through the Services; (e) all of Your Content that may be incorporated into the Services shall be true, complete, and correct; and (f) you shall not bid on the vehicle you have listed at any auction thereof on the Services.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Bidders/Buyers</h3>
            <p>Each auction bidder/buyer acknowledges and agrees that (i) each bid submitted via the Services is binding on such bidder/buyer with respect to payment of the vehicle price and the applicable Clasiq fees, and (ii) such bidder/buyer is responsible for all applicable government fees and taxes for vehicles purchased via the Services. Sellers are not responsible for any shipping or delivery fees. While Clasiq may provide a pre-purchase inspection, we recommend that buyers conduct or arrange for their own in-person inspections as buyers are not permitted to rely on the pre-purchase inspections, which come with no express or implied warranties (see Section 13 below for disclaimers).</p>
            <p>CLASIQ DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO, AND BIDDER/BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT CLASIQ SHALL BEAR NO RISK, RESPONSIBILITY, OR LIABILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH, PURCHASING OF A VEHICLE LISTED VIA THE SERVICES OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY OF THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE PROVIDED ON THE CLASIQ WEBSITE (www.clasiq.com) OR OTHER SERVICES AS MAY BE PROVIDED BY CLASIQ OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH PURCHASE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, VEHICLE DESCRIPTIONS, HISTORIES, VIDEOS, PHOTOS, PRE-PURCHASE INSPECTIONS, VEHICLE REPORTS, SELLER Q&A RESPONSES, COMMENTS, VALUATION TOOLS, STATISTICS OR ANALYTICS ON PRICING, OR OTHER INFORMATION).</p>
            <p>CLASIQ FURTHER DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WITH RESPECT TO, AND BIDDER/BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT CLASIQ SHALL BEAR NO RISK, RESPONSIBILITY, OR LIABILITY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO OR ASSOCIATED WITH, ANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY INTEGRATIONS MADE AVAILABLE BY CLASIQ.</p>
            <p>IN ADDITION, BIDDER/BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREE THAT NEITHER CLASIQ NOR THE APPLICABLE SELLER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INADVERTENT TYPOGRAPHICAL AND OTHER ERRORS THAT MAY APPEAR ON THE SERVICES. IF THERE IS INCORRECT INFORMATION ON A VEHICLE LISTING (E.G., PRICE, AVAILABILITY, DESCRIPTION, CONDITION, MILEAGE, OR HISTORY) DUE TO A TYPOGRAPHICAL OR OTHER ERROR, CLASIQ RESERVES THE RIGHT TO REFUSE OR CANCEL SUCH LISTING, EVEN IF THE APPLICABLE AUCTION HAS ALREADY EXPIRED.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Customer Support</h3>
            <p>Customer support is provided by phone, email, and chat functionality through the Services. Please see the contact or about us page for more details. Customers may use these support resources to ask questions and to report errors or problems with the Services.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Consent to Electronic Communications and Solicitation</h3>
            <p>You agree that we may send you (including via email) information regarding the Services, such as notices about your use of the Services, updates to the Services and new features or offerings, and promotional information and materials. Notices emailed to you will be considered given and received when the email is sent.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Your Content</h3>

            <p>THIS SECTION 17 SHOULD BE BROADLY CONSTRUED TO COVER ANY CLAIM RELATING TO ANY ASPECT OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THESE TERMS.</p>
            <p>You agree that in the event you have any Claim against us, you will first contact us and make a good faith sustained effort to resolve the Claim before resorting to more formal means of resolution, including without limitation arbitration or any court action. You may contact us through the means described on the Services or at info@clasiq.com. “Claim” means any claim, dispute, demand, proceeding, cause of action, judgment, damage, liability, loss, cost, or expense (including but not limited to reasonable attorneys’ fees) of any kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, that has accrued or may hereafter accrue, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including but not limited to fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, negligence, or any other intentional tort), or any other legal or equitable theory.</p>
            <p>IN THE EVENT ANY CLAIM CANNOT BE INFORMALLY RESOLVED, YOU AND WE AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL CLAIMS ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS, RATHER THAN LITIGATE THE CLAIM IN COURT, EXCEPT FOR THE CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM ARBITRATION LISTED BELOW IN SECTION 17.4. ARBITRATION MEANS YOU WILL HAVE A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY. BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND WE EACH AGREE TO WAIVE THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY FOR ALL CLAIMS, EXCEPT FOR THE CLAIMS EXCLUDED FROM ARBITRATION LISTED BELOW IN SECTION 17.4.</p>
            <p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with its Consumer Arbitration Rules. For more information about the AAA and the arbitration process, please visit the AAA website at www.adr.org.</p>
            <p>Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules and applicable law. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except those issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of this arbitration provision are for the court to decide. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this arbitration provision. The laws of the United States, State of California, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws, applies to any arbitration under this section.</p>
            <p>Unless you and we agree otherwise, any in-person hearings for the arbitration shall take place in Los Angeles, California, unless otherwise required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s ruling is binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive any termination of these Terms, including any termination of your relationship with us.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Restrictions on Claims</h3>
            <p>AN ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIM SUBJECT TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION MUST BE FILED WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR OF THE DATE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE EVENT OR FACTS GIVING RISE TO SUCH CLAIM, OTHERWISE, THE CLAIM IS BARRED AND THE RIGHT TO PURSUE SUCH CLAIM IS WAIVED.</p>
            <p>BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS, YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN OR BRING A CLASS ACTION IN COURT OR A CLASS ARBITRATION. ALL PARTIES MUST BE INDIVIDUALLY NAMED. TO THE FULL EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THERE SHALL BE NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY CLAIMS TO BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED IN COURT ON A CLASS ACTION OR CONSOLIDATED BASIS ON BEHALF OF OTHER USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, REGISTRANTS, OR OTHER PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED, OR BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY ON BEHALF OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC (SUCH AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL). AS STATED MORE FULLY IN SECTION 15 ABOVE, ALL PARTIES WAIVE ANY CLAIM TO INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, COVER, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, REVENUE, GOODWILL, USE OR CONTENT) ARISING FROM OR OUT OF ANY CLAIM WITH US.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Excluded Claims</h3>
            <p>WE AND YOU AGREE THAT THE FOLLOWING WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION (“EXCLUDED CLAIMS”):</p>
            <ul>
                <li>ANY CLAIM FILED BY YOU OR US IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT WHERE THE AMOUNT IN CONTROVERSY IS PROPERLY WITHIN THE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURT; AND ANY CLAIM REGARDING ANY PARTY’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. You further agree that for Excluded Claims and other Claims in which arbitration is denied,
                    <ol>
                        <li>the restrictions set forth in Sections 17.3 above shall apply;</li>

                        <li>such Claims will be resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in Los Angeles, California, and you specifically consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and waive any claim of forum non conveniens. Should there be a conflict between the laws of California, and any other laws, the conflict will be resolved in favor of California law.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Severability</h3>
            <p>If for any reason an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms, or portion thereof, to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision or portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to give effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of these Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THESE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU MUST NOTIFY US IN WRITING BY CONTACTING US AT THE ADDRESS BELOW WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST ACCESS, VISIT, REGISTER FOR, AND/OR USE THE SERVICES. YOUR WRITTEN NOTIFICATION TO US MUST INCLUDE: (1) YOUR FULL NAME AND ADDRESS; (2) THE NAME OF THE SERVICES YOU ACCESSED, VISITED, REGISTERED FOR, AND/OR USED; AND (3) A CLEAR STATEMENT THAT YOU DO NOT WISH TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITH US THROUGH ARBITRATION AND YOU DO NOT WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO BRING A CLASS ACTION IN COURT. YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER WILL HAVE NO ADVERSE EFFECT ON YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH US OR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES. IF YOU HAVE PREVIOUSLY NOTIFIED US OF YOUR DECISION TO OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION AND THE CLASS ACTION WAIVER, YOU DO NOT NEED TO DO SO AGAIN.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Waiver</h3>
            <p>The failure of either of us to insist upon or enforce strict performance of any of the provisions of these Terms or to exercise any of our respective rights or remedies will not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment to any extent of such right to assert or rely upon any such provision, right, or remedy in that or any other instance, all of which will remain in full force and effect.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-3 text-theme">Entire Agreement</h3>
            <h3 class="heading-4 text-theme">Severability</h3>
            <p>These Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any government authority holds that we cannot enforce a part of these Terms as written, you and we will replace such part with similar terms to the extent enforceable under the relevant law, but the rest of these Terms will remain in effect. This is the entire agreement between you and us regarding its subject matter and supersedes any oral and written understandings, communications, or agreements regarding your use of the Services or other matters described in these Terms.</p>

            <p>You agree that these Terms, and your relationship with Clasiq will be governed by the laws of the State of California regardless of conflict-of-laws principles.

We both agree that the prevailing party in any action to enforce these Terms will be entitled to recover costs and expenses including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’ fees and other legal costs.</p>
